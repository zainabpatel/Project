<h2>History of BLM:</h2>
<p>
The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was created in 2013 by  Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, three Black women, 
        in response to the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/07/13/201918229/judge-to-zimmerman-you-have-no-further-business-with-the-court?t=1594745717424"
                              >acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman.</a>
        It is inclusive of all Black people and 
        particularly aims to amplify the voices of women and queer people. </p>
        
<p>
The movement originated in the US but has existed for many centuries in many forms and countries. It exists today in the form of 
        protest for freedom and equality against a society that has continued to systemically deny the rights of Black people. The 
        first protests were nearly 400 years ago, when the first African enslaved people resisted being property of white colonisers in the US. </p>
        
<p>
 <a href="https://freedomcenter.org/voice/preliminary-emancipation-proclamation" target="_blank">The Emancipation Proclamation </a>
        of 1862 and <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act">The Civil Rights Act </a>
        of 1964 were huge cornerstones in the movement, but Black Americans 
        still face an overwhelming amount of racism which requires overhauls of entire institutions to dismantle.</p>

<p><h3>A Brief Timeline of events:</h3></p>
<p><ul>
        <li><b>1619-1865:</b> Harriet Tubman, a famous abolitionist, escaped slavery and helped to free over 70 slaves through the Underground Railroad. 
        Many other enslaved people fought for their freedom.</li>
<li><b>1920s:</b> Huge cultural changes challenged racism in Harlem, New York.</li>
<li><b>1930s:</b>The rise of the Civil Rights movement, led by prominent figures such as Malcolm X.</li>
<li><b>1955-56:</b> Civil Rights protests against segregation became more widespread, particularly after Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing 
        to give up her seat on a bus for a white man.</li>
<li><b>1963:</b> Martin Luther King gave his famous ‘I Have a Dream’ speech at a massive protest march in Washington, DC, calling for civil and 
        economic rights for Black Americans. </li>
<li><b>1965:</b> Protest marches from Selma to Montgomery were met with violence and police resistance. Week-long protests against police 
        brutality and racial profiling in Los Angeles resulted in the death of 3 dozen people. </li>
<li><b>1968:</b> Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised the Black Power fist at Madison Square Garden at the Olympics in Mexico. This 
        sparked more Black Power protests throughout the 70s.</li>
<li><b>1973:</b> The National Black Feminist Organisation was founded to address issues faced by Black women. </li>
<li><b>1965-76:</b> Protests, rallies and boycotts led by Martin Luther King aimed to end segregation, create inclusive education systems and 
        address health disparities for Black Americans. </li>
<li><b>1966-82:</b> The Black Panther Party, a political party led by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, was formed to challenge racial misconduct and 
        protect Black Americans from police brutality. The Black Liberation Movement built on this idea. </li>
<li><b>1992:</b> Riots broke out in Los Angeles after the police who severely beat up a Black man called Rodney King were acquitted.</li>
<li><b>2013-present day:</b> The Black Lives Matter movement started in 2013. Colin Kaepernick and other prominent athletes kneeled at sporting 
        events in 2016. A huge amount of international support for the movement ensued after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery 
        and Breonna Taylor.</p></li>
